Assign4: Due 11:59PM November 13th

We will program the problem given below using three different languages.

Do not mutate any variables and dont' use recursion.

We will create a console application that will select a number between 0 and 100. Ask the user to guess the number selected. If the user guess higher or lower, let the user know. If the user guesses the right value, print the number of attempts they took to make the right guess and quit the program.

Create a build file to run the tests and to execute the program.

Ask for frequent reviews.

Languages:
One is dynamically typed, one is statically typed, a third is your choice.
One of the languages you pick should be the one no one on your team has used so far in the previous assignments.
Do not use Java, C/C++, C#, Python, PHP, or JavaScript. 
Please do not select all languages that run on the same ecosystem, like JVM, .NET, Apple products, etc.
